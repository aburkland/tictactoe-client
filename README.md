# Project 1 - Tic Tac Toe

## Planning and Development Process
For my first project as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive,
I built a single page application that allows a person to create a user account
in order to play a game of tic-tac-toe.

I began by reviewing the project requirements and project documentation. I then
created my wireframes and user stories to help guide me in my project schedule.
I started by setting up my authentication with the API and then moved on to
developing my game logic. I tried to break problems down into bite-sized pieces,
using pseudocode and comments along the way. I would test features by logging
messages to the console to help me discern where roadblocks and bugs were
occuring.

## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- JQuery
- HTML5
- CSS

## Unsolved Problems for Future Fixes
I created an error message to appear when there were complications with
updating the API, but I believe this will confuse the user. I hope to better
understand the process for creating error messages that are useful. Additionally,
my 'New Game' button must be clicked in order to play a game; in the future, I
would like the user to be able to start a game by clicking on the game board.
Lastly, I was focused on meeting the project requirements and thus did not
focus on styling; I would like to add a Bootstrap template and add more
formatting.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to create a user account so that I can access the tic tac toe game.
- As a user, I want to log-in to my account, so that I can play tic tac toe.
- As a user, I want to choose a position on the board, so that I can place an X or O there.
- As a user, I want to receive a message, so that I know whether my move is successful or not.
- As a user, I want to click a button, so I can see how many games I've played.
- As a user, I want to sign-out, so I am no longer logged into the account.
